## Flashy
Flashy (Geschniegelt) is a simple python program built mainly on tkinter that helps the user memorize and familiarize the user with the German language, it shows the user one of the most common 500 words randomly, and 3 seconds later, its correct translation.  
The user can then either hit the tick mark to convey to the program that they know the word and it won't be shown to them again.

## Other applications
Flashy imports data from data/words.csv, you can modify the data inside for other languages as required using Google Sheets and =GoogleTranslate(CELLNUMBER,"other language code", "en"). (Documentation for GOOGLETRANSLATE)[https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093331?hl=en]
